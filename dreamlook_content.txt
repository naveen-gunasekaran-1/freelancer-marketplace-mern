	•	EXISTING SYSTEM
From the requirement analysis it is clear that there is no existing system currently in place for Dream Look to manage the items. The company is currently relying on a manual book to keep track of their items, which can be inefficient and prone to errors. The new database management website will provide a digital platform to streamline the product management process, improve efficiency, and reduce the likelihood of errors. By implementing this new system, Dream Look can better manage their products and improve the overall effectiveness of their business operations.

	•	SYSTEM STUDY
	•	Understanding the Business Requirements

The first step in the system study is to understand the business requirements of the project. This involves identifying the business objectives, target audience, and the features and functionalities required in the website.

	•	Analyzing the Existing Systems and Processes

The next step is to analyze the existing systems and processes in place, including the current website and any related software systems. This will help identify any limitations or areas for improvement in the new website.


	•	Identifying User Needs

The system study should also involve identifying the needs of the users who will be accessing the website. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or other user research methods.

	•	Developing Use Cases

Use cases can be developed to illustrate how the website will function and how users will interact with it. This can help identify any potential issues or areas for improvement in the design and functionality.


	•	OBJECTIVE
The objective of DREAM LOOK is to establish a robust online presence, extending its expertise in men's fashion to a global audience. Through a dedicated website, the company aims to showcase its diverse range of clothing items, including suits, shirts, pants, jackets, T-shirts, and trousers. By leveraging e-commerce capabilities, the website will enable customers from various locations to explore the collection, place orders conveniently, and enjoy a seamless shopping experience. Additionally, the website will serve as a platform for effective communication with clients, fostering engagement and building lasting

relationships. DREAM LOOK strives to become a go-to destination for men seeking stylish and high-quality fashion essentials, catering to their needs with expertise and excellence.

	•	SCOPE

The scope of Dream Look's men's fashion store encompasses a comprehensive range of apparel, accessories, and grooming essentials tailored to meet the diverse needs and preferences of modern men. From timeless classics to avant-garde trends, the store offers a curated selection of high-quality garments crafted from premium materials, ensuring both style and durability. It caters to various lifestyles and occasions, including casual wear, formal attire, athleisure, and special events, providing options for every aspect of a man's wardrobe. In addition to clothing, the store features a wide array of accessories such as shoes, belts, hats, and bags, as well as grooming products and skincare essentials to complete the look. Dream Look prioritizes inclusivity and diversity, offering sizes, styles, and designs that cater to men of all body types, ages, and cultural backgrounds. With a focus on sustainability and ethical practices, the store sources from eco-friendly brands and promotes conscious consumption. Through its online platform, Dream Look extends its reach globally, allowing customers to access its curated offerings from anywhere, at any time. Moreover, the store provides personalized styling services and fashion advice to help customers discover their signature style and express themselves with confidence. By staying abreast of emerging trends and consumer preferences, Dream Look continually updates its inventory and enhances its shopping experience to remain a leader in men's fashion.

CHAPTER 4 DETAILED DESIGN

	•	ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN

The architectural design includes various diagrams such as use case diagram, sequence diagram and activity diagram for both user and admin modules.

	•	MODULE CHARACTERISTICS

The project contains two modules as follows and their description is given
below.
	•	User module
	•	Admin module


	•	User Module

The user module contains a home page, projects page, about us page and contact us page. The user can view all the pages as mentioned in the user module flow FIGURE 4.1






FIGURE 4.1 FLOWCHART


	•	USE CASE DIAGRAM

A use case diagram is a dynamic or behaviour diagram in UML. Use case diagrams model the functionality of a system using actors and use cases. Use cases are set of actions, services, and functions that the system needs to perform. A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses. Due to their simplistic nature, use case diagrams can be a good communication tool for stakeholders. FIGURE 4.2




FIGURE 4.2 USE CASE DIAGRAM

	•	SEQUENCE DIAGRAM

Sequence chart diagram is one of the five UML diagrams used to model the dynamic nature of a system. The admin defines the sequence of an object during its lifetime. FIGURE 4.3




FIGURE 4.3 SEQUENCE DIAGRAM



	•	INTERFACE DESIGN

The application provides various interfaces to the users that make them more convenient with the application. The user interface contains Home, About, Projects done by the company. Further the user can contact the company by giving their details, and approach the company. This is simple to use and clear to understand. The user can further provide feedback regarding the company. The user interface is more attractive and consistent on all interface screens. The interface is completely responsive.


	•	DATABASE DESIGN

The Database used in this system is MongoDB. In Mongo, the data is stored in the form of collections and documents. There are several collections like services to store, update, delete, retrieve as well as delete the projects done by the company, services to add or remove a admin and to store the Feedback that their customer provides. Customer details like name, email id, phone number of those who contacted through mail are stored in the MongoDB. FIGURE 4.4


FIGURE 4.4

	•	OUTPUT DESIGN

Output design generally refers to the results and information that are generated by the system for many end-users; it should be understandable with the enhanced format. Previewing the output reports by the user is extremely important because the user is the ultimate judge of the quality of the output and, in turn, the success of the system. The output is designed in such a way that it is attractive, convenient and informative.

CHAPTER 5 TESTING

	•	UNIT TESTING

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. Unit testing can be done manually, but is often automated. In this process, each module is considered as individual units and are tested for proper operation. If each module meets up with the user’s requirement, then it is subjected to integration testing where more than one module is integrated and tested.

	•	REGRESSION TESTING

Regression testing helps in identifying any unintended side effects or issues that may arise due to code changes, updates to dependencies, or modifications in the underlying infrastructure. By rerunning test cases, the development team can ensure that previously implemented features and functionality have not been negatively impacted by recent updates.The primary objective of regression testing is to ensure that the website remains fully functional, reliable, and user-friendly, even after modifications or enhancements have been made.Overall, regression testing serves as an essential quality assurance measure to maintain the integrity and performance of the website throughout its lifecycle. It helps in minimizing the risk of functional regressions, ensuring that the website continues to meet the expectations and requirements of the end users and stakeholders.

	•	VALIDATION TESTING

The process of evaluating software during the development process or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified business requirements. Validation Testing ensures that the service actually meets the client's needs. It can also be defined as to demonstrate that the service fulfils its intended use when deployed on appropriate environment.


	•	VERIFICATION TESTING

Verification is the process of evaluating work-service of a development phase to determine whether they meet the specified requirements. When developing each module, the individuality of the service is checked at its development stage. Thus ,the modules must be verified at the development stage.

	•	INTEGRATION TESTING

Integration tests are designed to test the integrated software components to determine if they actually run as a program. It is specifically aimed at exposing problems that arise from the combination of components. Integration testing is done after integration of the model with the core service. The integration testing can be done for our project by integrating the user module.

CHAPTER 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The development of the "Dream Look" online clothing store signifies a pivotal move towards adapting to the evolving retail landscape. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as ReactJS, MongoDB Atlas, Cloudinary, Stripe, and Node.js, the project aims to enhance customer reach, drive sales, and establish a prominent online presence. The seamless user experience, secure payment processing, and comprehensive product catalog promise unparalleled convenience and satisfaction to shoppers. Moving forward, continuous refinement and adaptation will be crucial to staying ahead in the competitive market. Future initiatives include enhancing personalization through advanced algorithms, integrating augmented reality for virtual try-on experiences, promoting sustainability initiatives, and expanding social commerce integration. Moreover, efforts towards international expansion, voice commerce, advanced analytics, community engagement, and loyalty programs will be pursued to maintain a competitive edge and drive sustained growth in the dynamic digital landscape.
